# Rust Fundamentals ðŸ¦€

Rust is an expression-based language, this means that most things are evaluated and return some value, anything that doesn't return a value is a statement.

```rust
// `let x` is a statement, `5 + 5` is an expression
let x = 5 + 5;
```

Rust uses the term panicking when a program exits with an error

## Variables

Variables are a way to assign data to a temporary memory location.

```rust
let price = 30;
let city = "NYC";
```

By default, variables are immutable. To make a variable mutable, use the `mut` keyword.

```rust
let mut discount_price = 49.99;
let mut name = "John";
```

### Constants

Constants are similar to variables, but they are immutable and must be annotated with a type, they must also have a value that can be computed at compile time.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;

fn main() {
    println!("The value of MAX_POINTS is: {}", MAX_POINTS);
}
```

Constants are more performant than variables because they are inlined wherever they are used.

### Shadowing

Shadowing lets us transform a variable in a way that is clear, type-safe, and performant. It also helps keep our code concise and self-documenting, reducing the mental overhead of tracking multiple variable names.

```rust
let spaces = " "; // spaces is a string
let spaces = spaces.len(); // now spaces is an integer, the length of the original string
```

## Functions

In Rust, returns are implicit. The last expression in a function is the return value.

The type of the return value is defined with `->`

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}

let res = add(5, 10); // 15
```

## Macros

In Rust, a macro is a way of defining reusable chunks of code. Macros in Rust are a bit similar to functions, but instead of generating a value, macros generate code snippets.

```rust
let life = 42;
println!("hello"); // hello
// The `:?` is for debugging purposes
println!("{:?}", life); // 42
println!("{life:?}"); // 42
// Without the `:?` it can be used for end users
println!("For end user: {life}"); // 42
println!("The meaning of {:?} is {:?}", life, life); // The meaning of 42 is 42
```

Creating a macro

```rust
macro_rules! say_hello {
    () => (
        // println! is also a macro
        println!("Hi!");
    )
}

...

say_hello!() // Output: "Hi!"
```

One of the main advantages of macros over functions in Rust is that they are more flexible and can accept a varying number of arguments, among other things.

Macros work through a process called macro expansion, where the macro is expanded to its body code before the code is compiled.

Macros can also be more difficult to write and debug than functions, so they should be usedÂ judiciously.

## Control Flow

### If statements

```rust
let x = 5;

// No parentheses around the condition
if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
} else if x == 6 {
    println!("x is six!");
} else {
    println!("x is not five or six :(");
}
```

### Loops

```rust
let mut x = 0;

// loop is an infinite loop until a break statement is reached
loop {
    if x == 5 {
        break;
    }

    // Prints 0 through 4
    println!("{x:?}");
    x += 1;
}

// Executes while the condition is true
while x > 0 {
    // Prints 5 through 1
    println!("{x:?}");
    x -= 1;
}
```

You can return values out of a loop by adding an expression after the `break` keyword, like so:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;

let result = loop {
    counter += 1;

    if counter == 10 {
        // Will return 20 and break out of the loop
        break counter * 2;
    }
};
println!("The result is {result}"); // "The result is 20"
```

### Match expressions

Match expressions are a much more powerful switch statemen

Match expressions must be exhaustive, they should account for every possible result, so if a match is used for controlling an action on an enum value, the compiler throw an error if that is not accounted for

```rust
let some_bool = true;

match some_bool {
    true => println!("Is true"),
    false => println!("Is false"),
}

let some_int = 5;
match some_int {
    1 => println!("Is one"),
    2 => println!("Is two"),
    3 => println!("Is three"),
    // NOTE _ is the default case
    _ => println!("Is something else"),
}
```

## Modules

Modules are a way to organize code and control the privacy of paths. A module is a collection of items: functions, structs, traits, impl blocks, and even other modules.

```rust
mod my_module {
    // Items in modules default to private visibility
    fn private_function() {
        println!("called `my_module::private_function()`");
    }

    // Use the `pub` modifier to override default visibility.
    pub fn function() {
        println!("called `my_module::function()`");
    }

    // Modules can also be nested
    pub mod nested {
        pub fn function() {
            println!("called `my_module::nested::function()`");
        }

        #[allow(dead_code)]
        fn private_function() {
            println!("called `my_module::nested::private_function()`");
        }
    }

    // pub(crate) makes functions visible only within the current crate
    pub(crate) fn public_function_in_crate() {
        println!("called `my_module::public_function_in_crate()`");
    }
}
```
