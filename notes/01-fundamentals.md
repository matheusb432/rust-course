# Rust Fundamentals ðŸ¦€

- Rust is an expression-based language, this means that most things are evaluated and return some value, anything that doesn't return a value is a statement.

```rust
// `let x` is a statement & `5 + 5` is an expression
let x = 5 + 5;
```

## Variables

- Variables are a way to assign data to a temporary memory location.
- By default, variables are immutable. To make a variable mutable, use the `mut` keyword.

```rust
let price = 30;
let mut discount_price = 49.99;
```

### Constants

- Constants are similar to variables, but they are immutable and must be annotated with a type, they must also have a value that can be computed at compile time.
- Constants are more performant than variables because they are inlined wherever they are used.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
// Lifetime will elide to `&'static str`
const COOKIE_NAME: &str = "auth_token";

println!("The cookie name is: {}", COOKIE_NAME);
println!("The value of MAX_POINTS is: {}", MAX_POINTS);
```

### Shadowing

- Shadowing lets us transform a variable in a way that is clear, type-safe, and performant. It also helps keep our code concise and self-documenting, reducing the mental overhead of tracking multiple variable names.

```rust
let spaces = " "; // spaces is a string
let spaces = spaces.len(); // now spaces is an integer, the length of the original string
```

- Another benefit of shadowing is `temporary mutability`, we can make a variable mutable only for the necessary parts of our code.

```rust
let mut age = 30;
age = 42;
let age = age; // age => 42

// This can also be done with a scope
let age = {
    let mut age = 30;
    age = 42;
    age // => 42
};
```

## Functions

- In Rust, returns are implicit. The last expression in a function is the return value.
- Writing Rust functions is a careful balance of asking for the right levelÂ ofÂ permission, meaning that not every functions needs to take ownership or mutate data.

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
let res = add(5, 10); // 15
```

## Expressions

- Expression values coalesce to a single point, this enables variables to be set to the result of an expression.
- It's also possible to nest expressions, but it should be limited to 2 or 3 levels of nesting so the code doesn't become too complex

```rust
let my_num = 3;
// Setting is_lt_5 to the result of the expression
let is_lt_5 = if my_num < 5 {
    true
} else {
    false
};
// Equivalent since the ternary expression would be redundant
let is_lt_5 = my_num < 5;
```

## Closure

- A closure is simply an anonymous function. It can be stored in a variable, passed as an argument to a function, or returned from a function.

```rust
// A closure that takes no arguments and returns nothing
let say_hello = || println!("Hello!");
// A closure that takes two arguments and returns the sum of them
let sum = |a, b| -> i32 { a + b };
```

## Macros

- In Rust, a macro is a way of defining reusable chunks of code. Macros in Rust are a bit similar to functions, but instead of generating a value, macros generate code snippets.

```rust
let life = 42;
// Invoking the println! macro
println!("hello"); // hello
println!("{:?}", life); // 42
```

## Control Flow

### If statements

```rust
let x = 5;

// No parentheses around the condition
if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
} else if x == 6 {
    println!("x is six!");
} else {
    println!("x is not five or six :(");
}
```

### Loops

```rust
let mut x = 0;

// loop is an infinite loop until a break statement is reached
loop {
    if x == 5 {
        break;
    }

    // Prints 0 through 4
    println!("{x:?}");
    x += 1;
}

// Executes while the condition is true
while x > 0 {
    // Prints 5 through 1
    println!("{x:?}");
    x -= 1;
}
```

You can return values out of a loop by adding an expression after the `break` keyword, like so:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;

let result = loop {
    counter += 1;

    if counter == 10 {
        // Will return 20 and break out of the loop
        break counter * 2;
    }
};
println!("The result is {result}"); // "The result is 20"
```

### Match expressions

- Match expressions are a much more powerful switch statement
- Match expressions must be exhaustive, they should account for every possible result, so if a match is used for controlling an action on an enum value, the compiler throw an error if that is not accounted for

```rust
let some_bool = true;
match some_bool {
    true => println!("Is true"),
    false => println!("Is false"),
}

let some_int = 5;
match some_int {
    1 => println!("Is one"),
    2 => println!("Is two"),
    3 => println!("Is three"),
    // _ is the default case
    _ => println!("Is something else"),
}
```

## Modules

- Modules are a way to organize code and control the privacy of paths. A module is a collection of items: functions, structs, traits, impl blocks, and even other modules.

```rust
mod my_module {
    // Items in modules default to private visibility
    fn private_function() {
        println!("called `my_module::private_function()`");
    }

    // Use the `pub` modifier to override default visibility.
    pub fn function() {
        println!("called `my_module::function()`");
    }
}
```

### Crates

- A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate. A binary crate is an executable, and a library crate is a collection of code that can be imported into other crates.

## Overloading traits

### Equality & Ordering

- When comparing structs with the PartialEq, all fields must be exactly the same to return true on a `a == b` comparison, PartialOrd trait, only the first field of a struct is compared in ordering comparisons
- This enables easier sorting and comparison of structs

### Operators

- Operators can be overloaded by implementing operator traits

```rust
use std::ops::Add;

struct Speed(u32);

impl Add<Self> for Speed {
    type Output = Self;

    fn add(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        Speed(slef.0 + rhs.0)
    }
}

// This is now possible and will call the add method of the implementation
let fast = Speed(5) + Speed(3); // Speed(8)

// Implementations for different types can be done since the operator trait is generic
impl Add<u32> for Speed {
    type Output = Self;

    fn add(self, rhs: u32) -> Self::Output {
        Speed(self.0 + rhs)
    }
}
let fast = Speed(5) + 3; // Speed(8)
```

Indexing can also be overloaded by implementing the `Index` trait

```rust
use std::ops::Index;

struct Hvac {
    current_temp: i16,
    min_temp: i16,
    max_temp: i16,
}
enum Temp {
    Current,
    Max,
    Min,
}
impl Index<Temp> for Hvac {
    type Output = i16;

    fn index(&self, temp: Temp) -> &Self::Output {
        match temp {
            Temp::Current => &self.current_temp,
            Temp::Max => &self.max_temp,
            Temp::Min => &self.min_temp,
        }
    }
}
let env = Hvac {
    current_temp: 20,
    min_temp: 15,
    max_temp: 25,
};
// Now we can index the struct with the implemented enum
let current = env[Temp::Current]; // 20
```

### Iterators Traits

- Iteration is provided by the `Iterator` trait, it's what provides the `for..in` syntax and access to the iterator adapters `map, filter, ...`
- Can be implemented for any struct

```rust
// Iterator trait signature
trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

- The `IntoIterator` trait is used to convert a type into an iterator, it's implemented for types that can be used as collections, like arrays, vectors, and strings

```rust
// IntoIterator trait signature
trait IntoIterator
{
    type Item;
    type IntoIter;

    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter;
}
```
